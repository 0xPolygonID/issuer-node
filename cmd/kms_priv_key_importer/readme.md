### Requirements
You have to have installed the following tools:
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install)
- [aws cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) -- if you want to import your private key to AWS KMS or Secrets Manager
- [openssl](https://www.openssl.org/) -- if you want to import your private key to AWS KMS

this tools needs the following environment variables to be set up:
```
# Could be either [localstorage | vault | aws-sm] (BJJ) and [localstorage | vault | aws-sm |aws-kms] | aws (ETH)
ISSUER_PUBLISH_KEY_PATH=pbkey
ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER=aws-sm or aws-kms

# if the plugin is localstorage, you can specify the file path (default path is current directory)
# Important!!!: this path must be the same as the one used by the issuer node (defined in .env-issuer file)
ISSUER_KMS_PROVIDER_LOCAL_STORAGE_FILE_PATH=./localstoragekeys

# If the plugin is AWS for ETH keys you need to specify the key id and secret key
ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PLUGIN_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=XXX
ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PLUGIN_AWS_SECRET_KEY=YYY
ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PLUGIN_AWS_REGION=eu-west-1
ISSUER_KMS_AWS_URL=<optional-aws-url>

# if the plugin is vault, you can specify the vault address and token
ISSUER_KEY_STORE_ADDRESS=http://localhost:8200
ISSUER_KEY_STORE_PLUGIN_IDEN3_MOUNT_PATH=iden3

# if the plugin is vault, you can specify the authentication method
ISSUER_VAULT_USERPASS_AUTH_ENABLED=false
ISSUER_VAULT_USERPASS_AUTH_PASSWORD=issuernodepwd
```

Instead of setting the environment variables you use the `.env-issuer` file, you can copy the `.env-issuer.example` 
file and rename it to `.env-issuer` and set the values of the environment variables there.
Then from the root project folder you can run the following command **(just for vault o localstorage)**:

```shell
$ go run cmd/kms_priv_key_importer/main.go --privateKey <privateETHKey>
````
or you can build the binary and run it:

```shell
$ go build -o kms_priv_key_importer cmd/kms_priv_key_importer/main.go
```

and then run:

```shell
 ./kms_priv_key_importer --privateKey <privateETHKey>
```


### How import your private key to AWS KMS
First you need to create a new key in AWS KMS, so export the variables defined in the requirements section:
```shell
export ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER=aws-kms
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-access-key>
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_SECRET_KEY=<aws-secret-key>
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_REGION=<aws-region>
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_URL=<aws_endpoint_url> # optional
```
and run the following command:

```shell
$ go run .
```
To get the key id you have to take a look at the output (or logs) of the previous command, it will be something like:

```logs
2024/07/10 10:38:14 INFO alias created: alias:=alias/pbkey
2024/07/10 10:38:14 INFO key created keyId=157a8b2a-e5e9-4414-b9c5-301ce828f6c5
```

then you can import your private key using the following command:

```shell
$ chmod +x aws_kms_material_key_imporer.sh
$ ./kms_priv_key_importer <privateETHKey> <key-id> <aws-profile> [<aws_endpoint_url>]
```

where:
* `privateETHKey` is your private key in hex format (`d3bdf6f80e510b2efed2d1dd2652f3ad5d433b8eeff0cb622d426d259576b551`)
* `key-id` is the key id of the key created in AWS KMS (in this example `157a8b2a-e5e9-4414-b9c5-301ce828f6c5`)
* `aws-profile` is the profile name in your `~/.aws/credentials` file
* `aws-region` is the region where the key was created
* `aws-endpoint-url` is the endpoint url of the AWS KMS service (optional)

if you get `Key material successfully imported!!!` message, then your private key was successfully imported to AWS KMS.


### How import your private key to AWS Secrets Manager
Export the variables defined in the requirements section:
```shell
export ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER=aws-kms
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-access-key>
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_SECRET_KEY=<aws-secret-key>
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_REGION=<aws-region>
export ISSUER_KMS_AWS_URL=<aws_endpoint_url> # optional
```
and run the following command:

```shell
$ go run . --privateKey <privateETHKey>
```
that's it, your private key was successfully imported to AWS Secrets Manager.


### Running Importer with Docker (AWS KMS)
In the root project folder run:

```shell
docker build --build-arg ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-access-key> \
  --build-arg ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER_AWS_SECRET_KEY=<aws-secret-key> \
  --build-arg ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER_AWS_REGION=<aws-region> --build-arg=<aws_endpoint_url> -t privadoid-kms-importer -f ./Dockerfile-kms-importer .
```

Note: if you don't have an endpoint url, you can remove the `--build-arg=<aws_endpoint_url>` argument from the command above.

After the docker image is created run the following command (make sure you have the .env-issuer with your env vars):

```shell
docker run -it -v ./.env-issuer:/.env-issuer privadoid-kms-importer sh
```

inside the container `privadoid-kms-importer` execute:

```
./kms_priv_key_importer
```

you will see something like this:

```shell
2024/07/10 15:27:54 INFO alias created: alias:=alias/pbkey
2024/07/10 15:27:54 INFO key created keyId=9bb5b78b-c288-44a7-b1d4-0543e0a6
```

then import the material key

```shell
sh ./aws_kms_material_key_importer.sh <private-key> <keyId> privadoid [<aws_endpoint_url>]
```
if you get `Key material successfully imported!!!` message, then your private key was successfully imported to AWS KMS.


### Running Importer with Docker (AWS Secrets Manager)
In the root project folder run:

```shell
docker build --build-arg ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER_AWS_ACCESS_KEY=<aws-access-key> \
  --build-arg ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER_AWS_SECRET_KEY=<aws-secret-key> \
  --build-arg ISSUER_KMS_ETH_PROVIDER_AWS_REGION=<aws-region> --build-arg=<aws_endpoint_url> -t privadoid-kms-importer -f ./Dockerfile-kms-importer .
```

after the docker image is created run the following command (make sure you have the .env-issuer with your env vars):

```shell
docker run -it -v ./.env-issuer:/.env-issuer privadoid-kms-importer sh
```

inside the container `privadoid-kms-importer` execute:

```shell
./kms_priv_key_importer --privateKey <ETH-PRIV-KEY>
```
