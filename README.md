# Polygon ID Issuer Node

[![Checks](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/sh-id-platform/actions/workflows/checks.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/sh-id-platform/actions/workflows/checks.yml)
[![golangci-lint](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/sh-id-platform/actions/workflows/golangci-lint.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/0xPolygonID/sh-id-platform/actions/workflows/golangci-lint.yml)

This is a set of tools and APIs for issuers of zk-proof credentials, designed to be extensible. It allows an authenticated user to create schemas for issuing and managing credentials of identities. It also provides a [user interface](ui/README.md) to manage issuer schemas, credentials, issuer state and connections.

This repository is for anyone to create their own [issuer node](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/issuer-node/issuer-node-overview/) for Polygon ID.

---

## Installation

There are two options for installing and running the server alongside the UI:

1. [Docker Setup Guide](#docker-setup-guide)
2. [Standalone Mode Guide](#standalone-mode-guide)

### Docker Setup Guide

Running the app with Docker allows for minimal installation and a quick setup. This is recommended **for evaluation use-cases only**, such as local development builds.

#### (Optional) Quick Start Steps

These steps can be followed to get up and running with all features as quickly as possible.

> **NOTE:** For more detailed step-by-step instructions and guides to commands and examples, you may skip to the next section.

1. Copy `.env-api.sample` as `.env-api` and `.env-issuer.sample` as `.env-issuer`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
1. Run `make up`. This launches 3 containers with Postgres, Redis and Vault. Ignore the warnings about variables, since those are set up in the next step.
1. **If you are on an Apple Silicon chip (e.g. M1/M2), run `make run-arm`**. Otherwise, run `make run`. This starts up the issuer API, whose frontend can be accessed via the browser (default <http://localhost:3001>).
1. [Add](#import-wallet-private-key-to-vault) your Ethereum private key to the Vault.
1. [Add](#add-vault-to-configuration-file) the Vault to the config.
1. [Create](#create-issuer-did) your issuer DID.
1. _(Optional)_ To run the UI with its own API, first copy `.env-ui.sample` as `.env-ui`. Please see the [configuration](#development-ui) section for more details.
1. _(Optional)_ Run `make run-ui` (or `make run-ui-arm` on Apple Silicon) to have the Web UI available on <http://localhost:8088> (in production mode). Its HTTP auth credentials are set in `.env-ui`. The UI API also has a frontend for API documentation (default <http://localhost:3002>).

#### Docker Guide Requirements

- Unix-based operating system (e.g. Debian, Arch, Mac OS)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) `1.27+`
- Makefile toolchain `GNU Make 3.81`

> **NOTE:** There is no compatibility with Windows environments at this time.

To help expedite a lot of the Docker commands, many have been abstracted using `make` commands. Included in the following sections are the equivalent Docker commands that show what is being run.

#### Create Docker Configuration Files

Make a copy of the following environment variables files:

```bash
# FROM: ./

cp .env-api.sample .env-api;
cp .env-issuer.sample .env-issuer;
# (Optional - For issuer UI)
cp .env-ui.sample .env-ui;
```

#### Node Issuer Configuration

The `.env-issuer` will be loaded into the [Docker compose initializer](/infrastructure/local/docker-compose.yml)

Any of the following RPC providers can be used:

- [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)
- [Ankr](https://ankr.com/)
- [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com/)
- [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
- [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)

If it is desired to run a free public forwarding URL, see [Getting A Public URL](#getting-a-public-url).

Configure `.env-issuer` with the following details (or amend as desired).

```bash
# ...

# See Section: Getting A Public URL
ISSUER_SERVER_URL=<https://unique-forwaring-or-public-url.ngrok-free.app>
# Defaults for Basic Auth in Base64 ("user-issuer:password-issuer" = "dXNlci1pc3N1ZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQtaXNzdWVy")
# If you just want to get started, don't change these
ISSUER_API_AUTH_USER=user-issuer
ISSUER_API_AUTH_PASSWORD=password-issuer
# !!!MUST BE SET or other steps will not work
ISSUER_ETHEREUM_URL=<YOUR_RPC_PROVIDER_URI_ENDPOINT>
```

> **NOTE:** In case the Vault was loaded multiple times and a fresh start is needed, the following will remove remnant data:

```bash
# FROM: ./

make clean-vault;
# (Equivalent)
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/data/init.out
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/file/core/
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/file/logical/
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/file/sys/

# Expected Output/Prompt:
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/data/init.out
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/file/core/
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/file/logical/
#   rm -R infrastructure/local/.vault/file/sys/
```

#### Start Redis Postgres & Vault

This will start the necessary local services needed to store the wallet private key to the Hashicorp vault and allow storing data associated to the issuer.

```bash
# FROM: ./

make up;
# (Equivalent)
#   docker compose -p issuer -f ./infrastructure/local/docker-compose-infra.yml up -d redis postgres vault;

# Expected Output:
#   docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/infrastructure/local/docker-compose-infra.yml up -d redis postgres vault
#   [+] Running 4/4
#   ⠿ Network issuer-network       Created                                                                                   0.0s
#   ⠿ Container issuer-vault-1     Started                                                                                   0.5s
#   ⠿ Container issuer-redis-1     Started                                                                                   0.4s
#   ⠿ Container issuer-postgres-1  Started  
```

To remove all services, run the following (ignore the warnings):

```bash
# FROM: ./

make down; 
# (Equivalent)
#   docker compose -p issuer -f ./infrastructure/local/docker-compose-infra.yml down --remove-orphans -v;

# Expected Output:
#   docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/infrastructure/local/docker-compose-infra.yml down --remove-orphans
#   [+] Running 4/3
#   ⠿ Container issuer-postgres-1  Removed                                                                                   0.2s

#   WARN[0000] The "DOCKER_FILE" variable is not set. Defaulting to a blank string.
```

#### Import Wallet Private Key To Vault

In order to secure the wallet private key so that the issuer can use it to issue credentials, it must be stored in the Hashicorp Vault.

> **NOTE:** Make sure the wallet that is provided has Testnet Matic to be able to send transactions.

```bash
# FROM: ./

# Make sure to verify that the issuer-vault-1 is full initialized to avoid: "Error writing data to iden3/import/pbkey: Error making API request."
make private_key=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY> add-private-key;
# (Equivalent)
#   docker exec issuer-vault-1 vault write iden3/import/pbkey key_type=ethereum private_key=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>;

# Expected Output:
#   docker exec issuer-vault-1 \
#           vault write iden3/import/pbkey key_type=ethereum private_key=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY>
#   Success! Data written to: iden3/import/pbkey
```

#### Add Vault To Configuration File

This will get the vault token from the Hashicorp vault docker instance and add it to our `./env-issuer` file.

```bash
# FROM: ./

make add-vault-token;
# (Equivalent)
#   TOKEN=$(docker logs issuer-vault-1 2>&1 | grep " .hvs" | awk  '{print $2}' | tail -1);
# sed '/ISSUER_KEY_STORE_TOKEN/d' .env-issuer > .env-issuer.tmp;
# echo ISSUER_KEY_STORE_TOKEN=$TOKEN >> .env-issuer.tmp;
# mv .env-issuer.tmp .env-issuer;

# Expected Output:
#   sed '/ISSUER_KEY_STORE_TOKEN/d' .env-issuer > .env-issuer.tmp
#   mv .env-issuer.tmp .env-issuer
```

#### Create Issuer DID

> **NOTE:** This can also be done via the [UI API](#using-the-ui-api).

This will create a new issuer DID by creating a new Docker instance of the issuer, generating the DID of the issuer, storing it in the database, then deleting the instance.

It then copies the new DID to `.env-api`.

**For _NON-Apple-M1/M2/Arm_ (ex: Intel/AMD):**

```bash
# FROM: ./

# NON-Apple-M1/M2/Arm Command:
make generate-issuer-did;
# (Equivalent)
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile" docker compose -p issuer -f ./infrastructure/local/docker-compose.yml up -d initializer
# sleep 5
#  $(eval DID = $(shell docker logs -f --tail 1 issuer-initializer-1 | grep "did"))
#  @echo $(DID)
#  sed '/ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID/d' .env-api > .env-api.tmp
#  @echo ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID=$(DID) >> .env-api.tmp
#  mv .env-api.tmp .env-api
#  docker rm issuer-initializer-1
```

**For _Apple-M1/M2/Arm_:**

```bash
# FROM: ./

#   DID=$(docker logs -f --tail 1 issuer-initializer-1 | grep "did");
#   echo $DID;
#   sed '/ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID/d' .env-api > .env-api.tmp;
#   echo ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID=$DID >> .env-api.tmp;
#   mv .env-api.tmp .env-api;
#   docker rm issuer-initializer-1;

# Expected Output:

#   docker rm issuer-initializer-1
#   issuer-initializer-1
```

#### Start Issuer API

Now that the issuer API is configured, it can be started.

**For _NON-Apple-M1/M2/Arm_ (ex: Intel/AMD):**

```bash
# FROM: ./

make run;
# (Equivalent)
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile" docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/infrastructure/local/docker-compose.yml up -d api;

# Expected Output:
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile" docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/local/docker-compose.yml up -d api;
```

**For _Apple-M1/M2/Arm_:**

```bash
# FROM: ./

make run-arm;
# (Equivalent)
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile-arm" docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/infrastructure/local/docker-compose.yml up -d api;

# Expected Output:
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile-arm" docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/local/docker-compose.yml up -d api;
#   WARN[0000] Found orphan containers ([issuer-vault-1 issuer-postgres-1 issuer-redis-1]) for this project. If you removed or renamed this service in your compose file, you can run this command with the --remove-orphans flag to clean it up. 
```

Navigating to <http://localhost:3001> shows te issuer API's frontend:

![Issuer API frontend](docs/assets/img/3001.png)

#### (Optional) Configure UI

This step is required to run the separate UI application, which allows intuitive and convenient management of schemas, credentials, connections and issuer state.

> **NOTE:** Running and using the UI is optional, since it implements funcionality already exposed via the [UI API](#using-the-ui-api). It is highly recommended though, because it makes issuer management far simpler and more intuitive.

```bash
# FROM: ./

cp .env-ui.sample .env-ui;
```

Configure the `.env-ui` file with the following details (or amend as desired):

```bash
ISSUER_UI_BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL=https://mumbai.polygonscan.com
ISSUER_UI_AUTH_USERNAME=user-ui
ISSUER_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD=password-ui
```

#### Start API UI, UI, Notifications server & Publisher

This will start the UI API that exposes endpoints to manage schemas, credentials, connections and issuer state, as well as the UI that relies on it.

**For _NON-Apple-M1/M2/Arm_ (ex: Intel/AMD):**

```bash
# FROM: ./

make run-ui;
# (Equivalent)
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile" docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/local/docker-compose.yml up -d api-ui ui notifications pending_publisher;

# Expected Output:
#   COMPOSE_DOCKER_CLI_BUILD=1 DOCKER_FILE="Dockerfile" docker compose -p issuer -f /Users/username/path/to/sh-id-platform/infrastructure/local/docker-compose.yml up -d api-ui ui notifications pending_publisher

#    ⠿ Container issuer-pending_publisher-1  Running  
```

Now navigate to <http://localhost:3002> to see the UI API's frontend:

![Issuer UI API frontend](docs/assets/img/3002.png)

#### Using the UI API

Make sure to set the HTTP authentication credentials in `.env-api` to the following:

```bash
# ...

ISSUER_API_UI_AUTH_USER=user-api
ISSUER_API_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD=password-api
```

Then authenticate via the following form on <http://localhost:3002>:

![Issuer UI API Authentication](docs/assets/img/3002-auth.png)

This allows you to make a request via any of the endpoints using this frontend.

![Issuer UI API Get Credentials](docs/assets/img/3002-credentials.png)

#### (Optional) Using the UI

This service is running on <http://localhost:8088>.

> **NOTE:** If you are using Chrome, you might get the HTTP auth modal showing and disappearing quickly. To remedy this, use the following URL: <http://user-api:password-api@localhost:8088/>.

File containing the basic auth credentials: `.env-ui`

```bash
# ...

ISSUER_UI_AUTH_USERNAME=user-ui
ISSUER_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD=password-ui
```

![Issuer UI](docs/assets/img/8088.png)

> **NOTE:** If you want to run the UI app in development mode, i.e. with HMR enabled, please follow the steps in the [Development (UI)](#development-ui) section.

---

### Standalone Mode Guide

Running the app in standalone mode means you will need to install the binaries for the server to run natively. This is essential for production deployments.

Make sure you have Postgres, Redis and Vault properly installed & configured. Do _not_ use `make up` since those will start the containers for non-production builds, see [Docker Setup Guide](#docker-setup-guide).

#### Standalone Mode Guide Requirements

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) 1.27
- Makefile toolchain
- Unix-based operating system (e.g. Debian, Arch, Mac OS X)
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.20
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault)

#### Standalone Mode Setup

1. Copy `.env-api.sample` as `.env-api` and `.env-issuer.sample` as `.env-issuer`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
1. Run `make build-local`. This will generate a binary for each of the following commands:
   - `platform`
   - `platform_ui`
   - `migrate`
   - `pending_publisher`
   - `notifications`
   - `issuer_initializer`
1. Run `make db/migrate`. This checks the database structure and applies any changes to the database schema.
1. Run `./bin/platform` command to start the issuer.
1. Run `./bin/pending_publisher`. This checks that publishing transactions to the blockchain works.
1. [Add](#import-wallet-private-key-to-vault) your Ethereum private key to the Vault.
1. [Add](#add-vault-to-configuration-file) the Vault to the config.
1. [Create](#create-issuer-did) your issuer DID.
1. _(Optional)_ To set up the UI with its own API, first copy `.env-ui.sample` as `.env-ui`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
1. _Documentation pending: standalone UI setup._

## Issuing Credentials via CLI

Once the [Installation](#installation) is completed, the following will walk you through issuing credentials via a CLI.

> **NOTE:** These steps can be done either via the API UI (<http://localhost:3001>) or directly in the UI (<http://localhost:8088>) (see [Docker setup](#docker-setup-guide)).

### Create Identity

> **NOTE:** This is an alternative to the following: [Create Issuer ID](#create-issuer-did).

```bash
# NOTE: dXNlci1pc3N1ZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQtaXNzdWVy is a Basic HTTP Authorization as base64(user-issuer:password-issuer) from our .env-issuer file
curl --location 'http://localhost:3001/v1/identities' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlci1pc3N1ZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQtaXNzdWVy' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "didMetadata":{
        "method": "polygonid",
        "blockchain":"polygon",
        "network": "mumbai"
    }
}';

# Expected Output:
#   {"identifier":"did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qPdb2hNczpXhkTDXfrNmmt9fGMzfDHewUnqGLahYE","state":{"claimsTreeRoot":"eb3d346d16f849b3cc2be69bfc58091dfaf6d90574be26bb40222aea67e08505","createdAt":"2023-03-22T22:49:02.782896Z","modifiedAt":"2023-03-22T22:49:02.782896Z","state":"b25cf54e7e648a263658416194c41ef6ae2dec101c50dfb2febc5e96eaa87110","status":"confirmed"}}
```

### (Optional) View Existing DIDs (connections)

A connection is a DID that is linked to the issuer when they authenticate via an issued credential.

#### Option 1 - Using the UI

_Documentation pending_

#### Option 2 - Using a CLI

This will output all DIDs (i.e. connections) that have been created with the issuer.

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3001/v1/identities' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlci1pc3N1ZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQtaXNzdWVy' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "did_metadata":{
        "method": "polygonid",
        "blockchain":"polygon",
        "network": "mumbai"
    }
}';

### Creating Credentials

This will go through creating a `KYCAgeCredential` credential based off the following [KYC Age Credential Schema](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json/KYCAgeCredential-v3.json)

#### Option 1 - Using the UI

_Documentation pending_

#### Option 2 - Using a CLI

Before creating a credential, the identifier of the service/person is needed. To retrieve this, the `identifier` can be copied from the Polygon ID app to the clipboard.

!["ID Within Polygon ID App"](docs/assets/img/polygonid-app-id.png)

> **NOTE:** The issuer node DID can be retrieved by looking at `.env-api` for `ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID`

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3001/v1/did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qPdb2hNczpXhkTDXfrNmmt9fGMzfDHewUnqGLahYE/claims' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlci1pc3N1ZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQtaXNzdWVy' \
--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
--data '{
    "credentialSchema":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json/KYCAgeCredential-v3.json",
    "type": "KYCAgeCredential",
    "credentialSubject": {
        "id": "did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qEsg1AeTohAq6Euc3hBaDapfLVfQiWS7DUfvutYEq",
        "birthday": 19960424,
        "documentType": 2
    }
}';

# Expected Output:
#   {"id":"b1eab5be-dea3-11ed-8f7d-0242ac1e0005"}
```

### (Optional) Verifying Credentials Creation

#### Option 1 - Using the UI

_Documentation pending_

#### Option 2 - Using a CLI

Using the previous generated credential ID from [Creating Credentials](#creating-credentials).

```bash
curl --location --request GET 'http://localhost:3001/v1/did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qPdb2hNczpXhkTDXfrNmmt9fGMzfDHewUnqGLahYE/claims/b1eab5be-dea3-11ed-8f7d-0242ac1e0005' \

### Issuing Credential To Polygon ID Wallet User

This will walk you through the steps of issuing a credentials to the Polygon ID wallet app.

#### Option 1 - Using the UI

_Documentation pending_

#### Option 2 - Using a CLI

In order to get the credential on the Polygon ID App, the credential QR Code payload is needed.

```bash
curl --location 'http://localhost:3001/v1/did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qPdb2hNczpXhkTDXfrNmmt9fGMzfDHewUnqGLahYE/claims/b1eab5be-dea3-11ed-8f7d-0242ac1e0005/qrcode' \
--header 'Authorization: Basic dXNlci1pc3N1ZXI6cGFzc3dvcmQtaXNzdWVy';

# Expected Output:
#   {"body":{"credentials":[{"description":"https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iden3/claim-schema-vocab/main/schemas/json-ld/kyc-v3.json-ld#KYCAgeCredential","id":"b1eab5be-dea3-11ed-8f7d-0242ac1e0005"}],"url":"http://localhost:3001/v1/agent"},"from":"did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qPdb2hNczpXhkTDXfrNmmt9fGMzfDHewUnqGLahYE","id":"c01b66f1-d10b-4591-9dd6-8a94db1c112a","thid":"c01b66f1-d10b-4591-9dd6-8a94db1c112a","to":"did:polygonid:polygon:mumbai:2qEsg1AeTohAq6Euc3hBaDapfLVfQiWS7DUfvutYEq","typ":"application/iden3comm-plain-json","type":"https://iden3-communication.io/credentials/1.0/offer"}
```

Take this JSON data, copy, and paste into [https://qr.io](https://qr.io).

!["QR.io"](docs/assets/img/qrio.png)

With the Polygon ID app, open it up and scan the QR code.

### Verifying Credential

> **NOTE:** The goal is to build your own type of credential and ways to verify it, but this is an example of how things could work.

A quick way to validate this KYCAge Claim is to use [https://verifier-demo.polygonid.me/](https://verifier-demo.polygonid.me/).

_Documentation pending for tutorial_

### Getting A Public URL

In order for the service to work, we'll need a public url.
An easy way to set this up is with using [ngrok](https://ngrok.com) as a forwarding service that maps to a local port.

```bash
# FROM: /path/to/ngrok binary

./ngrok http 3001;

# Expected Output:
# Add OAuth and webhook security to your ngrok (its free!): https://ngrok.com/free
# 
# Session Status                online
# Account                       YourAccountUsername (Plan: Free)
# Update                        update available (version 3.2.1, Ctrl-U to update)
# Version                       3.1.0
# Region                        Europe (eu)
# Latency                       -
# Web Interface                 http://127.0.0.1:4040
# Forwarding                    https://unique-forwading-address.eu.ngrok.io -> http://localhost:3001
# 
# Connections                   ttl     opn     rt1     rt5     p50     p90
                              # 0       0       0.00    0.00    0.00    0.00
```

### Advanced setup

Any variable defined in the config file can be overwritten using environment variables. The binding for this environment variables is defined in the function `bindEnv()` in the file `internal/config/config.go`

An _experimental_ helper command is provided via `make config` to allow an interactive generation of the config file, but this requires Go 1.19.

---

## Development (UI)

Completing the [installation](#installation) process yields the UI as a minified Javascript app. Any changes to the UI source code would necessitate a full re-build to apply them. In most development scenarios this is undesirable, so the UI app can also be run in development mode like any [React](https://17.reactjs.org/) application to enable hot module replacement ([HMR](https://webpack.js.org/guides/hot-module-replacement/)).

1. Make sure that the UI API is set up and running properly (default <http://localhost:3002>).
2. Go to the `ui/` folder.
3. Copy the `.env.sample` file as `.env`
4. All variables are required to be set, with the exception of `VITE_ISSUER_LOGO`. The following are the corresponding variables present in the parent folder's `.env-api`, which need to be the same. Only `VITE_ISSUER_NAME` can differ for the UI to function in development mode.
   - `VITE_API_URL -> ISSUER_API_UI_SERVER_URL`
   - `VITE_API_USERNAME -> ISSUER_API_UI_AUTH_USER`
   - `VITE_API_PASSWORD -> ISSUER_API_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD`
   - `VITE_BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL -> ISSUER_UI_BLOCK_EXPLORER_URL`
   - `VITE_ISSUER_DID -> ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID`
   - `VITE_ISSUER_NAME -> ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_NAME`
   - `VITE_ISSUER_LOGO -> ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_LOGO`
5. Run `npm install`
6. Run `npm start`
7. The app will be running on <http://localhost:5173>.

## Troubleshooting

In case any of the spun-up domains shows a 404 or 401 error when accessing their respective URLs, the root cause can usually be determined by inspecting the Docker container logs.

```bash
$ docker ps
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE                COMMAND                  CREATED          STATUS                    PORTS                                       NAMES
60e992ea9271   issuer-api-ui        "sh -c 'sleep 4s && …"   15 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds              0.0.0.0:3002->3002/tcp, :::3002->3002/tcp   issuer-api-ui-1
fae8873ac23b   issuer-ui            "/bin/sh /app/script…"   15 seconds ago   Up 4 seconds              0.0.0.0:8088->80/tcp, :::8088->80/tcp       issuer-ui-1

abd1d3c93255   redis:6-alpine       "docker-entrypoint.s…"   34 minutes ago   Up 34 minutes (healthy)   0.0.0.0:6379->6379/tcp, :::6379->6379/tcp   issuer-redis-1
0912c9920294   vault:latest         "docker-entrypoint.s…"   34 minutes ago   Up 34 minutes             0.0.0.0:8200->8200/tcp, :::8200->8200/tcp   issuer-vault-1
```

For example, for inspecting the issuer API node, run:

`docker logs issuer-api-1`

In most cases, a startup failure will be due to erroneous environment variables. In the case of the UI, any missing environment variable(s) will show as part of the error message.

### Made Changes To Code But Not Showing In Docker?

There is a good chance that you just need to rebuild the docker images if you made any changes to the golang code or any other services.

To rebuild the docker images, just run the following (this might take a bit):

**For _NON-Apple-M1/M2/Arm_ (ex: Intel/AMD):**

```bash
# FROM: ./

# for `api` and `pending_publisher`
make build;
# for `api-ui` `ui` `notifications`and ` pending_publisher`
make build-ui;

# Expected Output:
#   ...
```

**For _Apple-M1/M2/Arm_:**

```bash
# FROM: ./

# for `api` and `pending_publisher`
make build-arm;
# for `api-ui` `ui` `notifications`and ` pending_publisher`
make build-ui-arm;

# Expected Output:
#   ...
```
