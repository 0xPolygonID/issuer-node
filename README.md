## Quick Start Installation
> [!NOTE]
> The provided installation guide is **non-production** ready. For production deployments please refer to  [Standalone Mode Guide](https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/issuer/setup-issuer-core/).
>
> There is no compatibility with Windows environments at this time. While using WSL should be ok, it's not officially supported.

### Prerequisites

- Unix-based operating system (e.g. Debian, Arch, Mac OS)
- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) `1.27+`
- Makefile toolchain `GNU Make 3.81`
- Publicly accessible URL - The issuer node API must be publicly reachable. Please make sure you properly configure your proxy or use a tool like [Localtunnel](https://theboroer.github.io/localtunnel-www/) or [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) for testing purposes. Localtunnel requires a one time password for each use, and the free version of ngrok only allows one agent.
- Polygon Amoy or Main RPC - You can get one in any of the providers of this list
    - [Chainstack](https://chainstack.com/)
    - [Ankr](https://ankr.com/)
    - [QuickNode](https://quicknode.com/)
    - [Alchemy](https://www.alchemy.com/)
    - [Infura](https://www.infura.io/)

### Issuer Node API

In this section we will cover the installation of the Issuer Node API.

> [!NOTE]
> This Quick Installation Guide is prepared for Polygon Amoy (Testnet) both for the state contract and issuer dids. If you want to deploy the node with Polygon Main configuration, please visit our [advanced Issuer Node configuration guide](https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/issuer/issuer-configuration/)).


#### Deploy Issuer Node Infrastructure

1. Copy the config sample files:

    ```shell
    cp .env-issuer.sample .env-issuer
    cp .env-api.sample .env-api
    ```

1. Fill the .env-issuer config file with the proper variables:

   *.env-issuer*
    ```bash
    ISSUER_ETHEREUM_URL=<YOUR_RPC_PROVIDER_URI_ENDPOINT>
    ```

 1. Start the infrastructure:

    ```bash
    make up
    ```

1. After initialization, ensure that instances (redis, vault and postgres) are active before proceeding to enable vault authentication. You can do this with `docker ps`

1. Enable vault authentication:

    ```bash
    make add-vault-token
    ```

1. Wait approximately 20 seconds to generate and store the token.
1. Write the private key in the vault. This step is needed in order to be able to transit the issuer's state. To perform that action the given account has to be funded. Make sure the account that you are using has sufficient amount of Amoy Test tokens. For Amoy network you can request some testing Matic [here](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/polygon-amoy). This step adds the generated token to the ISSUER_KEY_STORE_TOKEN var in .env-issuer, and stores the private key in the vault.

    ```bash
    make private_key=<YOUR_WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY> add-private-key
    ```
----
**Troubleshooting:**

In order to **stop** and **delete** all the containers.

``` bash
make down
```

If you experience **problems** with the **vault**, follow these commands:

> [!WARNING]
> This will permanently delete all data, making it necessary to create an Issuer DID again.

``` bash
docker stop issuer-vault-1    // Stops the container issuer-vault-1 
docker rm issuer-vault-1      // Removes container issuer-vault-1
sudo make clean-vault         // Removes all the data in the vault, including the token
docker volume prune           // remove unused docker volumes
```
Continue from step 3 above, where you run `make up`.

----
#### Run Issuer Node API

The issuer node is extensively configurable, for a detailed list of the configuration, please visit our [detailed configuration guide](https://devs.polygonid.com/docs/issuer/issuer-configuration/).

1. You can use ngrok to create tunnels for public access. The free version of ngrok allows only one agent, but you can create several tunnels with that one agent. For example, put the following in your ~/.config/ngrok.yml file
  ```
version: "2"
authtoken: *******************************
tunnels:
  issuernode:
    proto: http
    addr: 3001
  issuerapi:
    proto: http
    addr: 3002
  issuerui:
    proto: http
    addre: 8088    
  ```
 Then run `ngrok start --all`.
 If using localtunnel, run `lt --port 3001 --subdomain issuer-identities &` to create the public ISSUER_SERVER_URL. It yields: `https://issuer-identities.loca.lt`.
 If you are using the free version of ngrok or localtunnel, you may need to add a browser plugin like "simple-modify-headers" to inject headers into every request to avoid the warning message that is returned on first access to thwart abuse.
1. Fill the .env-issuer config file with the proper variables:

   *.env-issuer*
    ```bash
    ISSUER_API_AUTH_USER=user-issuer
    ISSUER_API_AUTH_PASSWORD=password-issuer
    ISSUER_SERVER_URL=<PUBLICLY_ACCESSIBLE_URL_POINTING_TO_ISSUER_SERVER_PORT>
    ISSUER_CREDENTIAL_STATUS_RHS_URL=<PUBLICLY_ACCESSIBLE_URL_POINTING_TO_ISSUER_SERVER_PORT>
    ```

1. Run api:

    ```bash
    make run
    ```

> Core API specification - http://localhost:3001/

---

**Troubleshooting:**

When running `docker ps`, if you see that a container did not start, or is unhealthy, you can use `docker logs <container-name>` to see what went wrong.

### Issuer Node UI

In this section we will cover the installation of the Issuer Node UI, before continuing with these steps, make sure that you have followed the [Deploy Issuer Node Infrastructure](#Deploy-Issuer-Node-Infrastructure) section before continuing.

In order to make the UI work, we will need configure some env variables in the `.env-api` file

1. Copy .env-ui sample file and fill the needed env variables:

    ```bash 
    cp .env-ui.sample .env-ui
    ```

    *.env-ui*
    ```bash
    ISSUER_UI_AUTH_USERNAME=user-ui
    ISSUER_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD=password-ui
    ```
    
    *.env-api*
    ```bash
    ISSUER_API_UI_SERVER_URL={PUBLICLY_ACCESSIBLE_URL_POINTING_TO_ISSUER_API_UI_SERVER_PORT}
    ```

    > **_NOTE:_**  It is possible to register custom did methods. This field accepts an array of objects in JSON format.</br>
     If you are using Polygon Amoy blockchain you can remove the below env variable from *.env-api*.
    > Example:
        ```
        ISSUER_CUSTOM_DID_METHODS='[{"blockchain":"linea","network":"testnet","networkFlag":"0b01000001","chainID":59140}]'
        ```

1. Generate Issuer DID:

    ```bash
    make generate-issuer-did
    ```

1. Run UI:

    ```bash
    make run-ui
    ```
   
1. Now you can access the application at the following URLS, or use the public ones that you created.
    >**API UI specification** - http://localhost:3002/
    >
    >**UI** - http://localhost:8088/

---
**Troubleshooting:**

Restart the ui:

```bash 
make restart-ui
```
