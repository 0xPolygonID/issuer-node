This is a set of tools and APIs for issuers of zk-proof credentials, designed to be extensible. It allows an authenticated user to create schemas for issuing and managing credentials of identities. It also provides a web-based [frontend (UI)](ui/README.md) to manage issuer schemas, credentials and connections.

## Installation

There are two options for installing and running the server alongside the UI.

### Option 1 - Using Docker only

Running the app with Docker allows for minimal installation and a quick setup. This is recommended **for evaluation use-cases only**, such as local development builds.

#### Requirements for Docker-only

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) 1.27+
- Makefile toolchain
- Unix-based operating system (e.g. Debian, Arch, Mac OS X)

_NB: There is no compatibility with Windows environments at this time._

#### Setup for Docker-only

1. Copy `.env-api.sample` as `.env-api` and `.env-issuer.sample` as `.env-issuer`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
2. Run `make up`. This launches 3 containers with Postgres, Redis and Vault. Ignore the warnings about variables, since those are set up in the next step.
3. **If you are on an Apple Silicon chip (e.g. M1/M2), run `make run-arm`**. Otherwise, run `make run`. This starts up the issuer API, whose admin frontend can be accessed via the browser (default <http://localhost:3001>).
4. Follow the [steps](#adding-ethereum-private-key-to-the-vault) for adding an Ethereum private key to the Vault.
5. Follow the [steps](#creating-the-issuer-did) for creating an identity as your issuer DID.
6. _(Optional)_ To run the UI with its own API, first copy `.env-ui.sample` as `.env-ui`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
7. _(Optional)_ Run `make run-ui` (or `make run-ui-arm` on Apple Silicon) to have the Web UI available on <http://localhost:8088>. Its HTTP auth credentials are set in `.env-ui`. The UI API also has a frontend for API documentation (default <http://localhost:3002>).

### Option 2 - Standalone mode

Running the app in standalone mode means you will need to install the binaries for the server to run natively. This is essential for production deployments.

#### Requirements for standalone mode

- [Docker Engine](https://docs.docker.com/engine/) 1.27
- Makefile toolchain
- Unix-based operating system (e.g. Debian, Arch, Mac OS X)
- [Go](https://go.dev/) 1.19
- [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [Hashicorp Vault](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault)

_NB: There is no compatibility with Windows environments at this time._

#### Setup for standalone mode

Make sure you have Postgres, Redis and Vault properly installed & configured. Do _not_ use `make up` since those will start the containers for non-production builds, see [option 1](#option-1---using-docker-only).

1. Copy `.env-api.sample` as `.env-api` and `.env-issuer.sample` as `.env-issuer`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
2. Run `make build`. This will generate a binary for each of the following commands:
    - `platform`
    - `migrate`
    - `pending_publisher`
    - `configurator`
3. Run `make db/migrate`. This checks the database structure and applies any changes to the database schema.
4. Follow the [steps](#adding-ethereum-private-key-to-the-vault) for adding an Ethereum private key to the Vault.
5. Run `./bin/platform` command to start the issuer.
6. Run `./bin/pending_publisher`. This checks that publishing transactions to the blockchain works.
7. Follow the [steps](#adding-ethereum-private-key-to-the-vault) for adding an Ethereum private key to the Vault.
8. Follow the [steps](#creating-the-issuer-did) for creating an identity as your issuer DID.
9. _(Optional)_ To set up the UI with its own API, first copy `.env-ui.sample` as `.env-ui`. Please see the [configuration](#configuration) section for more details.
10. _(Optional)_ Run `make run-ui` (or `make run-ui-arm` on Apple Silicon) to have the Web UI available on <http://localhost:8088>. Its HTTP auth credentials are set in `.env-ui`. The UI API also has a frontend for API documentation (default <http://localhost:3002>).

## Configuration

For a full user guide, please refer to the [getting started docs](https://0xpolygonid.github.io/tutorials/issuer-node/getting-started-flow).

### Turnkey Docker-only setup

If you are setting up [locally](#setup-for-docker-only) with Docker, you will need to set up the following variables in their respective `.env` files.

In `.env-api`:

- `ISSUER_API_UI_AUTH_USER`
- `ISSUER_API_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD`
- `ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID` - obtained from [here](#creating-the-issuer-did).
- `ISSUER_ETHEREUM_URL` - this is the Ethereum address of the issuer's DApp.
- `ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_LOGO` - optional (placeholder used if left blank). A valid URL to a minimum 40x40 pixel PNG, JPEG or SVG of the issuer's logo.

In `.env-issuer`:

- `ISSUER_API_AUTH_USER`
- `ISSUER_API_AUTH_PASSWORD`
- `ISSUER_KEY_STORE_TOKEN` - obtained from step 4 [here](#adding-ethereum-private-key-to-the-vault).

If you are running the UI, in `.env-ui`:

- `ISSUER_UI_AUTH_USERNAME`
- `ISSUER_UI_AUTH_PASSWORD`

### Adding Ethereum private key to the Vault

This is required for signing on-chain transactions. In a basic use-case this can be retrieved from an Ethereum wallet that can connect to Polygon Mumbai Testnet.

Follow these steps:

1. Copy your Ethereum private key, pasting it into `<private_key>` in the next step.
2. Run `make private_key=<private_key> add-private-key`
3. Run `make add-vault-token`

### Creating the issuer DID

This determines the owner of the credentials that are issued. You can either reuse an existing DID already configured, or you can generate a new identity running:`make generate-issuer-did` (or `generate-issuer-did-arm`) and a new issuer did must be in the environment variable `ISSUER_API_UI_ISSUER_DID` in `.env-api`


### Advanced setup

Any variable defined in the config file can be overwritten using environment variables. The binding for this environment variables is defined in the function `bindEnv()` in the file `internal/config/config.go`

An _experimental_ helper command is provided via `make config` to allow an interactive generation of the config file, but this requires Go 1.19.

## Development

[TODO]

- Developing the issuer API
- Developing the UI API
- Developing the UI (HMR enabled with env config)

## Testing

Start the testing environment with `make up-test`

- Run tests with `make tests` to run test or `make test-race` to run tests with the Go parameter `test --race`
- Run the linter with `make lint`

## Troubleshooting

In case any of the spun-up domains shows a 404 or 401 error when accessing their respective URLs, the root cause can usually be determined by inspecting the Docker container logs.

For example, for inspecting the issuer API node, run:

`docker logs issuer-api-1`

In most cases, a startup failure will be due to erroneous env variables.
