  title: Privado ID - Issuer
  description: |
    The Issuer Node Core API is ideal for users who need multiple identities and for integrator profiles, who want to 
    create solutions based on Privado ID functionalities and might be interested in having access to low level 
    information such as Merkle Trees.
    The Issuer Node API provide the following functionalities:
    * Create and retrieve Identities
    * Create a Verifiable Credential (VC)
    * Retrieve a Verifiable Credential or a list of Verifiable Credentials
    * Generate JSON to create a QR Code and use that to accept credentials in a wallet
    * Revoke a Verifiable Credential
    * Check revocation status of a Verifiable Credential
    * Retrieve the Revocation Status of a Verifiable Credential
    * Call Agent Endpoint using the Wallet App
    * Handle connections.
